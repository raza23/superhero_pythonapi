# superhero_pythonapi

Basic API I've made to get a hang of coding with Python and Django. Data is made up of my favorite superheros.

1. In order to run navigate to the first 'superhero' folder and run 'source bin/activate', which will take you to the virtual environment.
2. Once running in your virtualenv, navigate to the 'superhero_api" folder and run 'python manage.py runserver' which will then run the server and give you a url to navigate to. The url will contain the JSON of the API data.
